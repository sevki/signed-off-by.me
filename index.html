<h1>Signed-off-by?me</h1>
<code>tl;dr get me to <a href="#fix">fix</a></code>
<p>
Welcome to signed-off-by.me, you are probably here because you forgot to sign-off atleast one commit.
</p>
<h2>What does that mean?</h2>

By sigining-off your commits you make the <a href="#dco">following</a> declaration. <br/>
Simply put, by signing off your commits you are telling the maintainers that to the best of your knowledge
the patch you, or a third party, has created is able to be distributed under a compatible <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/">open-source license</a> amd it does not infringe on copyrighted material.
<h2 id="fix">Fix</h2>
If it's your last one, you are in luck, just do
<pre>
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
</pre>
and do a force push.
If you have more then one commit thats not signed-off<br/>
<pre>
git filter-branch --msg-filter "cat - && echo && echo 'Signed-off-by: Your Name <Your.Name@example.com>'" HEAD
</pre>
and do a force push.
